# MIT6.828-JOS-notes
My step-by-step notes of the JOS kernel. All the notes not only to tell you HOW but also WHY.

Note: To make sure the notes can guide you **step-by-step** and make you understand WHY, it may take a LONG time to upload a new note, and I can't promise that I would give the notes for ALL labs and homeworks. But I'll try my best :)

(You may wonder if there is a Chinese version. Hmmm, for now I would say, not this time. Maybe I'll think about it when I finish the English version.)

**DISCLAIMER: All the materials provided are to help you make your own answer. You would DEFINITELY NOT take the solutions as your own, as it is all YOUR DUTY to keep the academic integrity.**
